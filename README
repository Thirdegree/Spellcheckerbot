My only requests if you use this code is that you change the useragent to reflect who is running it, you leave the attribution, and if you make changes you make it clear what and where the changes are.

Features (main):
	SpellCheck
	Manual control by selected users from reddit (adding ignored users, subreddits)
	ignores [serious] posts
	ignores users who ask it to
	odd easter eggs
	users can suggest subreddits for the bot, requires a majority of a sub's mods to ok it

main_test only:
	identical to main atm


main.py should always work. main_test.py will probably work, but no promises.
